# XQR Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** 2026-01-13

This Privacy Policy explains how **XQR** (“the app”) handles information when you use it.

## What XQR does
XQR is a QR utility app that lets you:
- Scan QR codes
- Generate QR codes
- Optionally upload or capture an image to place as a center icon inside a generated QR code

## Information we collect
**XQR does not collect, store, or sell personal information.**  
XQR does not require you to create an account.

## Permissions we use (and why)
XQR may request the following permissions depending on features you use:

- **Camera (`android.permission.CAMERA`)**  
  Used only to scan QR codes and (if you choose) to capture an image to use as the center icon of a generated QR code.

- **Photos / Media (gallery access)**  
  Used only if you choose to select an image from your device to use as the center icon of a generated QR code.

## How your data is used
- **Scanning**: The camera feed is used to detect QR codes. XQR does not upload camera data to any server.
- **Generating QR codes**: The text you enter is used to generate a QR code on your device.
- **Center icon**: If you select or capture an image, it is used only to render the QR code on your device.

## Sharing
If you use the Share feature, XQR uses your device’s built-in sharing tools.  
Only the content you choose is shared, and it is shared through the apps/services you select.

## Data storage
XQR may temporarily keep your entered text or selected icon in the app while you are using it.  
XQR does not upload this information to any server.

## Third-party services
XQR does not include third-party advertising SDKs.  
If you install third-party apps to share content, those apps’ privacy practices are governed by their own policies.

## Children’s privacy
XQR is not intended for children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Changes to this policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the “Last updated” date above.
